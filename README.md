# simple-rest

A simple REST API using node.js with express.
It's an API to add books to a remote MongoDB database.

Later I'll make a Angular app using this REST API, to train my knowledge.

Next steps:
- [X] I'll add authentication;
- [ ] Proper error handling;
- [ ] Add tests;
- [X] I'll study promises to add to this project, to make it even easier to read.
